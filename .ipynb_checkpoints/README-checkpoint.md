# Python Lesson ILM & Escape Studios
### A 1-hour introduction to Python and image processing for audiences new to the subject.

To use it in your lessons
 - Share the Binder link (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/allarkaasik/PythonLessonILM/main) with your students
 - After it loads, open the PythonLessonILM.ipynb for an interactive lesson
 - The whole repo will be available on mybinder when following the link, so students can upload their own images to that session
 - The Exercise_Session.ipynb is a condensed version of the steps of the Porter&Duff (1984) Over operation for students to practice with their own images
 - The students can "save" their outputs to the "output" folder and download them from there
 - When you close the browser tab the session will be closed and all changes, uploaded images, and saved results will be lost.

The original Python code is based on an exercise written by Andrew Whitehurst.

The images are from the "Seeker" (2020) movie, directed by Rassoul Edji at Escape Studios (https://www.therookies.co/entries/7346)
