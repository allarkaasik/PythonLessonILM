    "Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python’s principal author, although it includes many contributions from others. (https://docs.python.org/3/license.html)\n",

    "\"In the very first instance, it's very flexible. It can be run as a simple standalone script, or as a module as a part of a bigger library of software tools. It caters to object orientated programming designs, but it doesn't have to. The syntax is clean, and while people don't like the fact it's not strongly typed, it's very accessible to new users. It runs across Mac, Windows and Unix platforms, so it's everywhere you need it to be. It also has means of being bound to C and C++ code sources, so high performance graphic functionality can be utilised via python. It's quick to prototype with it and its remarkably well supported. Lots of reasons. Here are the current VFX reasons...\n",
    "\n",
    "The main VFX players, Maya, Nuke, Mari, Houdini, Shotgun and, I'm willing to bet, Katana all have well integrated python interpreters built into them, as well as having extensive python APIs to allow a developer to extend the application's feature set. This is now standard. You can construct a nuke script entirely from python. Build a scene and load rigs in maya, set up your SOPs and ROPs in Houdini.\" (https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-real-plus-to-learn-Python-in-the-VFX-industry-What-good-formation-would-you-recomand-E-learning-or-tutorials)\n",
